# Advent of Code

## [About](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)

**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.<br />
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.<br />
<br />
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.<br />
Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
